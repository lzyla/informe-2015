            <p>This annual report of Civio (Fundación Ciudadana Civio: Civio Citizen Foundation) is an accountability practice that allows us to explain our pursuit, make all relevant information on our activities public and to share both positive and negative aspects of our evolution after this year. We have adopted this format for the second time (you can check our <a href="http://2014.civio.es/en/" title="Civio - Annual report 2014" target="_blank">report for 2014</a>) and we count on reviewing every period in an honest, critical and constructive way. We will endeavour to raise the bar and to keep working in a demanding and enthusiastic manner, in order to maintain the trust we have garnered from so many citizens and continue to win more and more every day.</p>
