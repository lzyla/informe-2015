          <p>Our relationship with public administration is <strong>transparent</strong> and <strong>disclosed to the public</strong>. Since May 2015 we have <a href="http://www.civio.es/registro-reuniones/" title="Civio - Record of meetings" target="_blank">informed</a> the public in detail of our lobbying meetings with public policy decision-makers. We have had <strong>19 meetings</strong> with various people, including the Ministry of Presidency, the Council of Transparency and Good Governance, among many parties with parliamentary representation and elected officials from the Madrid Regional Parliament. Through cooperation and the close relationships we have developed, we aim to facilitate the implementation of better transparency practices.</p>
          <p>We collaborate, for instance, by <strong>sharing highly specialized knowledge</strong> about our lines of work. Through this method, for the motion of the Ministry of Presidency, we formulated our <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/07/nuestras-recomendaciones-al-borrador-del-reglamento-de-la-ley-de-transparencia/" title="Civio - Our recommendations for the draft of the implementing regulations of the Transparency Act" target="_blank">recommendations</a> for the drafting of the implementing regulations of the Transparency Act, the future operating guide for the law's day-to-day enforcement, which is still waiting for approval. We have also <a href="http://transparencia.gob.es/transparencia/dam/jcr:04d31014-66af-405f-b235-c4665dcb9196/gobierno-abierto-comentario-FUNDACION-CIVIO.pdf" title="Civio's comments to the 2014-2015 OGP Action Plan" target="_blank">asked for</a> a thorough reform of Spain's <strong>2014-2015 Action Plan</strong> for the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org" title="Open Government Partnership" target="_blank">Open Government Partnership</a> (OGP) during the intermediate self-evaluation done by the Ministry of Presidency.</p>
          <p>In terms of transition projects in autonomous communities working towards a more transparent administration, in 2015 we have <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/12/recomendaciones-de-civio-al-anteproyecto-de-ley-de-transparencia-y-buen-gobierno-de-castilla-la-mancha/" title="Civio - Civio's recommendations for the draft of the Transparency and Good Governance Act of Castilla-La Mancha" target="_blank">contributed</a> to improve the drafting of the <strong>Transparency Act of Castilla-La Mancha</strong>. In addition, in the face of the regional and local elections held on the 24th of May, we shared a set of <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/04/recomendaciones-de-civio-para-una-mejora-efectiva-de-la-transparencia-ante-las-elecciones-municipales-y-autonomicas/" title="Civio - Civio's recommendations for an effective improvement on transparency in the face of municipal and regional elections." target="_blank">recommendations</a> aimed at improving transparency and accountability of newly elected governments. These proposals have been <strong>publicly adopted by different groups</strong>, including the Ciudadanos party in the Madrid Regional Parliament and other smaller political groups.</p>
          <p>Since its creation in 2015, we have started a close collaboration with the <a href="http://consejodetransparencia.es/ct_Home" title="Council for Transparency and Good Governance" target="_blank">Council of Transparency and Good Governance</a>, the main body responsible for enforcing the Transparency Act. Along this year Civio has had <a href="http://www.civio.es/registro-reuniones/" title="Civio - Record of meetings" target="_blank">four meetings</a> with the Council members we've collaborated to develop <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/11/asi-fue-nuestro-primer-taller-de-acceso-a-la-informacion-para-organizaciones-sociales/" title="Civio - See what happened at our first Access to Information workshop for social organisations" target="_blank">training</a> projects. This relationship has strengthened in 2016 with the signing of a <a href="http://www.civio.es/2016/02/el-consejo-de-transparencia-y-la-civio-colaboraran-para-difundir-el-derecho-a-acceder-a-la-informacion-publica/" title="The Council of Transparency and Civio will collaborate to promote the right of access to public information" target="_blank">collaboration protocol</a>.</p>
          <p>These efforts for increased public collaboration among all parties within the axes of transparency, accountability and active citizenship remains a priority for 2016.</p>
