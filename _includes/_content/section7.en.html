            <p>In 2015, our fourth financial year, we once again delivered a <strong>surplus</strong> (€ 49,650 approximately, in accounting profits). The income generated for 2015 implied over twice as much as last year (around € 227,300, when it amounted to € 99,212 in 2014), although expenses also escalated (some € 175,900, compared to € 92,939 from last year).</p>
            <p>We have experienced an <strong>increase in labor costs</strong> (which constituted 78% of the organisation's expenses) in 2015. Civio has become consolidated and grown, as our stable payroll team has added a permanent editor, a service manager as well as one person in charge of partnerships and advocacy (after the person formerly in charge opted out). The team is growing following the requirements of national and European projects, public service provision and our will to do better and more journalism.</p>
            <p>Our <strong>payment scheme for 2015</strong> is based on three elements:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Three wage levels, on a per annum gross basis: a basic salary of € 16,800, an intermediate level of € 18,500 and a top level of € 21,000. This wage scale has been revised upward for 2016.</li>
              <li>A variable bonus depending on each one's contribution to common goals, totalling € 10,000 gross for the operations team.</li>
              <li>An additional distribution of income generated through activities based on a high level of personal and direct contact, like classroom-based training delivery.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>2015 income (€ 227,318.94) arose from:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Private donations</strong> (€ 19,712.23, 9% out of total income).</p>
                <p>After closing the last day of 2014 with a symbolic and very significant number of 100 collaborators with periodical monthly donations supporting the foundation's activities with their effort, by December, 31st, 2015 we were closing with 207 <a href="http://www.civio.es/donaciones/" title="Civio - Donaciones" target="_blank">Civio's collaborators</a>. The income gained from donations is virtually the same as the former year (€ 19,064 for 2014, € 19,712.23 for 2015). The difference lies in the fact that this year we have not launched any crowdfunding campaign linked to projects.<i></i> Instead, we combined the efforts and brains of the whole team to prepare a modest agent recruitment campaign in the weeks prior to 2015 Christmas. Using the thinnest budget and totally out of our own resources, <a href="http://haztecomplice.civio.es" title="Civio - Become our accomplice" target="_blank">haztecomplice.civio.es</a> spread on social networks thanks to active engagement of dozens of donors and supporters, and <strong>we made the set goal</strong>: to reach over 200 collaborators to support our work on a monthly basis. In December we celebrated our annual agent meeting.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Professional service delivery</strong> (€ 71,594.69, 31% out of total).</p>
                <p>Services provided to the public sector, based on very specialised knowledge and aimed at bringing citizens closer to their administration and decisions, have gained wide acceptance during 2015,  especially toward the end of the year. This year, we have deployed transparency projects based on the platform <a href="http://dondevanmisimpuestos.es/" title="¿Dónde van mis impuestos?" target="_blank"><i>¿Dónde van mis impuestos?</i> (“Where do my taxes go?”)</a> for the local authorities of <a href="http://dondevanmisimpuestos.mostoles.es/" title="Móstoles municipal budgeting">Móstoles</a> (Madrid) and <a href="http://rubi.dondevanmisimpuestos.es/" title="Rubí municipal budgeting" target="_blank">Rubí</a> (Barcelona), and for the last quarter we have been fostering this line of work. As an outcome of this drive, in 2016 we are providing technical support to a number of governments both local and regional to innovate in matters of transparency. Among these, we find Barcelona, Santiago de Compostela and Castellón de la Plana.</p>
                <p>We must add the training taught for public sector professionals to these services (to Castilla y León Government staff) as well as for the media and several Journalism postgraduate programmes. For the third consecutive year, we have provided for consulting services to the BBVA bank Centre for Innovation, by creating content related to our working areas for their website. We have also contributed to mapping stakeholders and influencers within food industry and sugar consumption for Veterinarios sin Fronteras (Vets without Borders).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Institutional support</strong> (€ 135,012.02, 60% out of total income).</p>
                <p>These still arrive from outside the country only. In 2015 we were supported by <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/" title="Open Society Foundations" target="_blank">Open Society Foundations</a> in order to actively drive transparency and accountability in Spain, by the <a href="http://www.chest-project.eu" title="CHEST Project" target="_blank">Collective enHanced Environment for Social Tasks</a> European programme in order to develop the <a href="http://onodo.org/en/" title="Onodo" target="_blank"><i>Onodo</i> platform</a> and be able to launch it during the first half of year 2016, and from the <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/11/investigaremos-el-precio-de-medicamentos-en-paises-en-desarrollo-con-una-beca-del-cep/" title="We will investigate the price of medication in developing countries thanks to a grant from EJC" target="_blank">European Journalism Centre</a>, that endowed us with a <i>Journalism Grant</i> in order to extend the <a href="http://medicamentalia.org/en/" title="Medicamentalia" target="_blank"><i>Medicamentalia</i> project</a> for the investigation on access to vaccines.</p>
                <p>In 2016, we will add up our participation to the European Consortium for <a href="http://openbudgets.eu/" title="OpenBudgets" target="_blank"><i>OpenBudgets</i></a> to the provided support already mentioned. Our role within is taking place in the current year, so that in accountancy terms, this will also come to 2016 financial year balance.</p>

            <p><strong>...a more self-demanding character...</strong></p>
            <p>In 2015 we have abandoned the cash accounting principle and we have started applying accountancy on an accrual basis, which is more suitable for a more established organisation that is constantly growing in terms of projects. This is allowing us to reflect generated income and expenses associated to financed projects in a more coherent and consistent way for every financial year.</p>
            <p>In June 2016 our organisation will go through the first external audit on the 2015 accounts, an action also recommended for all the organisations within the foundation industry. Despite a very tight budget as an organisation, we believe that this is an investment that we must make in favor of transparency and our self-commitment.</p>
            <p><strong>...on a foundation for growth</strong></p>
            <p>All through 2016 we will go on collaborating with <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/" title="Open Society Foundations" target="_blank">Open Society Foundations</a> in order to develop political advocacy and training projects. During the first half of the year we count on having a high level of activity within the <a href="http://www.chest-project.eu/call-2-winners-announced/" title="CHEST Project - Call 2 winners announced" target="_blank">CHEST – Call 2 programme</a> in order to launch <a href="http://onodo.org/en/" title="Onodo" target="_blank"><i>Onodo</i></a>, and in 2017 we will execute our workloads for the <a href="http://openbudgets.eu/" title="OpenBudgets" target="_blank"><i>OpenBudgets</i> programme</a>.</p>
            <p>These past and future endorsements allow us to state that we count on approximately a 60% of our financing guaranteed for 2016. This growing stability has allowed on one hand to widen the team and, on the other, to comply with our 2015 expense budget, according to what we stated on our <a href="http://2014.civio.es/en/#cuentas-2014" title="Civio - Annual report 2014 - 2014 Accounts" target="_blank">2014 Annual Report</a>. The expense scenario for 2016, mainly due to the expansion of our task force and to the foreseen salary and social contribution rise, reaches around € 366,000. This reflects our constant desire to improve and to assign more human and technological resources to our projects. The new hirings as foreseen include our director's paychecks, after four years of unpaid efforts to Civio, as well as a programmer and a journalist, within the terms allowed by the Foundations Authority.</p>
            <p>We are committed to our donors and followers, and we are totally devoted to make sure we do not let them down regarding any of our areas of action. We will follow our current lines of work by updating <a href="http://www.civio.es/#latest-work" title="Civio - Projects" target="_blank">active projects</a>, as well as continuing to surprise everyone with new initiatives as <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/11/en-2016-ampliaremos-medicamentalia-investigando-el-acceso-global-a-las-vacunas/" title="Civio - In 2016 we will expand Medicamentalia by researching the global access to vaccines." target="_blank"><i>Medicamentalia - Vaccines</i></a>, <a href="http://quiencobralaobra.es" title="Quién cobra la obra" target="_blank"><i>Quién cobra la Obra</i></a>, <a href="http://onodo.org/" title="Onodo" target="_blank"><i>Onodo</i></a> and <a href="http://openbudgets.eu/" title="OpenBudgets" target="_blank"><i>OpenBudgets</i></a>.</p>
