              <p>As transparency gradually evolves to a practical implementation phase within institutions, organisations as Civio must make an extra effort to approach to and cooperate with the public sector, as well as with the whole institutional tissue. This cooperation, always considered for the <strong>middle and long terms</strong>, must keep a <strong>strategic, reciprocal, concrete and measurable character</strong> in order to lead to tangible improvements for citizens.</p>

              <p>Together with the scattered regulations that approving many different acts entails, one of the biggest challenges for Spain in 2016 in terms of transparency is the design of rigorous methodologies to <strong>assess its implementation</strong>. We believe that no system, ranking or quantitative assessment currently fostered can cast a thorough and thoughtful portrait regarding key qualitative factors, such as the completion and veracity of the information actively provided by institutions. In contrast with inaccurate measurements, we propose to perform modest observations but <strong>concrete, feasible, assessable and open to the participation of the citizenship</strong>.</p>

              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
              <p>In our 2014 Annual Report we stated that "<strong>Lack of transparency and stillness by authorities always come at a price</strong>. When institutions stop replying to requests, citizens become disaffected from transparency, stop seeking information and it <strong>entails a serious damage</strong>". During 2015 we have been able to verify that placing <strong>technical and administrative obstacles between institutions and citizens</strong> has an equally high cost in terms of mutual mistrust and disengagement. By the end of 2015, only 3,760 requests for information were processed, far away from those replied to by the United Kingdom or Chile, that amounted over 30,000 during their first year after their respective transparency acts came into force. The OTAI (Oficina de la Transparencia y Acceso a la Información: Office for Transparency and Access to Information), depending on the Ministry of Presidency, has not shared any diagnosis on this situation with the Spanish population. </p>

              <p>In Spain, the tissue of organisations (those having stable teams and rigorous methodology) specialized in the field of civic technology is still at <strong>a very early stage compared with other countries</strong>. It remains necessary to face outward in order to find models, success stories and a strategic vision on transparency and activism around it in the long run. During 2015 we have been collaborating already with this kind of organisations based in other countries and we are aware of the need to keep our links alive and seek further collaboration in the future, both inside as outside our borders.</p>

              <p>The <strong>diversification</strong> of income sources is becoming decisive for sustainability and growth in an organisation like Civio, that receives no state help. The provision of <a href="http://www.civio.es/sector-publico/" title="Civio - Public Sector" target="_blank">services</a>, based in <strong>specialised knowledge</strong> and with a <strong>high added value</strong>, is a key pillar for such matter. This is why we have strengthened our <strong>public sector service</strong> line, by improving handsomely our knowledge of their needs and growing as the independent <i>partner-of-choice</i> to help institutions to implement a civic approach to their transparency and open government actions. By offering newer and better services, in 2016 we will be able to help the public sector to create real and efficient transparency culture.</p>

              <p>International <strong>large donors</strong> mean a positive boost towards the implementation of better governance practices, as well as they are key to perform transnational scope projects requiring high levels of funding. We want to explore further a line of work consisting of starting a <strong>proactive</strong> relationship with large donors and to be able to obtain their support for projects that may not be a priority within their funding programmes, but which do correspond to a demonstrable need, making them worthwhile. In 2016 we are doubling our efforts to <strong>identify our potential travelling companions</strong>, both national and international, willing to bring about positive changes in society.</p>

              <p>Work planning demands experience, time and perspective in order to reach high quality standards. Despite filling up the vacancy in our team (our former fellow worker has taken a sabbatical year) and we have brought new talents to other areas of the foundation, we still find hardship for long-term planning in areas such as <strong>new personnel hiring</strong>, time devoted to <strong>active projects</strong> and <strong>new projects</strong>, as well as to expand <strong>our funding channels</strong>. In order to grow as a foundation in the long haul we need to make for a better planning according to <strong>well defined goals</strong>.</p>

              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
              <p>The day-to-day in a <strong>hybrid organization</strong> such as Civio —having the features of a media outlet, an activist organisation devote to its cause and a service provider to the public sector; is putting any standards meant to lead our work to the test. This is why <strong>clear and solidary policies</strong>, <strong>properly outlined procedures</strong> and <strong>some boundaries</strong> when necessary. This is to say, all that is needed to guarantee compliance to the most scrupulous standards of professionalism and to properly manage possible conflicts, both inside and outside the organisation, which may arise from such an unusual nature.</p>

              <p>During 2015, two critical decisions were made regarding our portfolio of initiatives: to <strong>close indefinitely the projects</strong> <a href="http://digodiego.es" title="DigoDiego" target="_blank"><i>DigoDiego</i></a> and <a href="http://tuderechoasaber.es" title="Tu Derecho a Saber" target="_blank"><i>Tu Derecho a Saber</i></a>. Both had become a statement of how hard it can be not only to start a project, but also to bring closure to initiatives that entailed a lot of effort to reach a certain degree of success and outreach. This is why it is an absolute necessity to find the <strong>right information and justification</strong> <a href="http://blog.tuderechoasaber.es/2015/12/cierra-tuderechoasaber/" title="Tu Derecho a Saber blog - Institutions' unwillingness to reply by electronic mail sentences Tu Derecho a Saber website to close" target="_blank">in detail</a> regarding such decisions. Truth is that <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/07/cerramos-digodiego-es-los-diputados-ya-pueden-tuitear-tranquilos/" title="Civio - We are shutting down DigoDiego.es: members of the Congress can tweet at ease now ;)" target="_blank">all the arguments</a> lead to this end, <strong>in a sincere and critical approach, and with the aim to keep learning</strong>. The acknowledgement of achieved advancements, in spite of these other two initiatives staying below the maximum potential we hoped, is also key for collaborators, volunteers, followers ans any person having participated in them properly understand the reasons for closing them.</p>

              <p>As we already stated on our 2014 report, “Civio's future relies on its accomplices, on our regular donor community. They allow us to plan our labour properly, and free us from depending solely on service provision, winning international contests or getting grants. Every donor is different, every donor has priorities and incentives of their own”. Hence, we must prove on a day-to-day basis, in every decision made, out of <strong>precision and reliability</strong>, that their support is worth the while.</p>
