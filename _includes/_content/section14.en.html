              <p>Over <strong>620,000 unique users</strong> have used our tools in 2015 in order to have access to better information on public administration and to play a more active part in society, which entails <strong>19% more than the figures from 2014</strong>. More and more citizens, organisations, bodies, social movements and public officers of all fields are contributing to the public debate we foster, based upon <strong>evidence and free access to data</strong>.</p>

              <p>We have participated and affected processes for the adaptation to transparency in autonomous community, municipality and sector levels. As a result of our recommendations, the policy support of public access to information has been <strong>strengthened and increased with better practices</strong> that will benefit thousands of citizens and organisations. Our <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/04/recomendaciones-de-civio-para-una-mejora-efectiva-de-la-transparencia-ante-las-elecciones-municipales-y-autonomicas/" title="Civio - Civio's recommendations for an effective improvement on transparency in the face of municipal and regional elections." target="_blank">municipal transparency recommendations</a> have been <strong>publicly adopted by several political groups</strong>, some of which have government duties.</p>

              <p>By the end of 2015, <strong>over five and a half million citizens</strong> know to which policies every euro from their taxes is assigned, thanks to our actions in mediating the understanding of public budgeting by the administration thanks to <a href="http://www.civio.es/sector-publico/#donde-van-mis-impuestos" title="Civio - Public sector - Dónde van mis impuestos" target="_blank"><i>Dónde van mis impuestos</i> (Where do my taxes go?)</a>. In 2016 we are taking a natural step towards helping public bodies not just to make their budgeting transparent, <strong>but also</strong> <a href="http://www.civio.es/sector-publico/#abre-decisiones-participacion-ciudadana" title="Civio - Public sector - Abre tus decisiones a la participación ciudadana" target="_blank">participatory</a>. This way, citizens will be able to express their priorities and translate them to public budgeting in institution s.</p>

              <p>Our <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es/" title="Civio proposals" target="_blank">11 measure for transparency and accountability</a> have been integrated in the electoral programmes of main parties. If such programmes are complied with, in the next political term, in Congress, there shall be a debate on <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es/#publicacion-de-la-ejecucion-presupuestaria-al-mismo-nivel-de-desglose-que-los-pge" title="Civio proposals - To publish budget implementation with the same level of detail than the General State Budget" target="_blank">detailed budget execution</a>, <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es/#publicacion-de-agendas-de-todos-los-altos-cargos-y-diputados-senadores-y-creacion-de-un-registro-del-lobby" title="Civio proposals - To publish the schedules of all the high officials, MPs and senators and to create a lobby registry" target="_blank">lobby registry</a> and agenda publishing, <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es/#publicacion-de-la-huella-legislativa-completa" title="Civio proposals - Full publishing of the legislative footprint" target="_blank">legislative footprint</a>, transparency in the purchase of <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es/#publicidad-detallada-de-los-acuerdos-entre-la-administracion-y-la-farmaceuticas-sobre-precios" title="Civio proposals - Detailed publicity of publicising of agreements between authorities and pharmaceutical companies on pricing" target="_blank">medicines</a> as well as the <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es/#publicacion-de-las-motivaciones-y-denegaciones-de-indultos-de-forma-argumentada" title="Civio proposals - Publishing of approvals and denials of Royal Pardons with arguments" target="_blank">reform of the laws for the Royal Pardon</a>, among other issues. Not only do we demonstrate that the civil society can include measures in their electoral commitments, but that it can be done in a <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es/partidos.html" title="Civio proposals - Parties" target="_blank">fully transparent way</a>. We will keep a <strong>strict surveillance</strong> on its accomplishment from the most independent stance.</p>

              <p>The civic purpose of our initiatives is fulfilled when we are able to set data free and to <strong>achieve social change</strong> thanks to them. Our best example is <a href="http://www.elindultometro.es/index.html" title="El indultómetro" target="_blank"><i>El Indultómetro</i> (the Pardonmeter)</a>. After three consecutive years watching the pardons granted, data demonstrated again that the Government is becoming much more careful with the use of this prerogative. At the time of closing this report, in 2015 were granted 73 royal pardons, which implies 17% below the former year, and the lowest since 1996. Social pressure is successful. To this end, we believe that having presented authoritative data in the debate on the use of the royal pardon carries a heavy weight in the number of times it has been granted.</p>

              <p>We go on raising the bar for transparency and open data good practice. And <strong>we are not the ones to say so</strong>. The <a href="http://www.opendatabarometer.org/" title="Open Data Barometer" target="_blank">Open Data Barometer</a> by the World Wide Web Foundation <a href="http://www.opendatabarometer.org/assets/data/primary_data_context_impact.csv" target="_blank">references</a> Civio's work of endowing public data with value, by mentioning the initiatives <i>Tu Derecho a Saber</i>, <i>El BOE nuestro de cada día</i>, <i>Quién Manda</i>, <i>El Indultómetro</i>, <i>Dónde van mis impuestos</i>, <i>DigoDiego</i> and <i>Escuela Civio</i>. Civio's endeavour was also displayed in the Open Data <a href="http://www.opendataenterprise.org/map.html" title="Open Data Enterprise - Map" target="_blank">Impact Map</a> by the centre for <a href="http://www.opendataenterprise.org" title="Open Data Enterprise" target="_blank">Open Data Enterprise</a>. Good practices tend to permeate: in April 2015, the Spanish Tax Agency started <a href="https://civio.box.com/s/wl66und0mqgu02pi13z7psvjmhqxjdo3" target="_blank">informing taxpayers for the first time in their revenue tax declaration how their taxes were being used</a> as we have been doing from 2011 via <i>Dónde van mis impuestos</i>.</p>

              <p>But our best victory has been to conclude also 2015 with <strong>positive balance</strong>, a <strong>growing and consolidated team</strong>, the motivation to face <strong>new challenges</strong> in 2016 and the confidence to commit to our donors and followers to meet their expectations.</p>
