            <p>Every one of our steps as an organisation (new projects, new relationships with the public sector, journalistic research, training given, etc.) is part of a deliberate effort to achieve social change. To better focus on our priorities, in 2015 we decided to put together a set of recommendations with <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es" title="Civio proposals" target="_blank">11 specific transparency and accountability proposals</a> and to get the main political parties' to pledge to enact them in practice. Working as lobbyist, we had open and public meetings with the representatives of six parties, in order to explain the reasons behind our proposals and explain how to put them into practice in a concrete, viable way. All of them have appeared in its <a href="http://propuestas.civio.es/partidos.html">electoral programmes</a>, though not to the same extent. Over 2016, once a government has formed, we will keep pressing the parties to adopt these proposals, in order to establish them as norms.</p>

            <p>The electoral programmes are not the only place where our proposals have demonstrated results. Some of our recommendations appear (literally in some cases) in the <a href="http://madrid.ciudadanos-cs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/06/AcuerdodeInvestiduraCs.pdf" title="Community of Madrid - Investiture agreement between Partido Popular and Ciudadanos" target="_blank">investiture agreement</a> between the Partido Popular and Ciudadanos to form government in the <strong>Community of Madrid</strong>. For instance, making all the documents regarding public tender and procurement processes fully accessible, as well as disclosure of the people taking part in each of the public procurement processes. The Guide for publishing the <a href="http://www.madrid.es/UnidadesDescentralizadas/Calidad/Transparencia/02_Institucional/Agendapublicaconcejales/ficheros/ManualAgendasconcejales.pdf" title="Madrid City Council - Guide for publishing the schedules of town councillors" target="_blank">schedules of town councillors</a> of the <strong>Madrid City Council</strong> has also taken our work into account.</p>
            <p>At Civio we promote the regulation of interest groups through our continuous work toward public awareness (within the framework of our project <i>Qui√©n Manda</i>), our meetings with public actors and our recommendations. Additionally, in 2015 we joined a coalition for the <strong>ethical regulation of lobbies</strong> in Spain, within the framework of the <a href="http://alter-eu.org/lobby-transparency-across-the-eu" title="ALTER-EU - Full lobby transparency now! across the EU" target="_blank">Alter EU</a> network, impulsed in our country by <a href="http://www.access-info.org" title="Access Info Europe" target="_blank">Access Info Europe</a>. The aim is to set <a href="http://lobbyingtransparency.net" title="International standards for lobbying regulation" target="_blank">international standards</a> that contribute to transparency regarding the activities of interest groups and thereby promote its implementation in Spain as well.</p>
            <p>This ongoing <i>advocacy</i> and public impact work has materialized in many of the <strong>victories we have achieved in 2015</strong> and that we address at the end of this report.</p>
