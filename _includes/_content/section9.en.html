            <p>Although not as much as we did In 2014, in 2015 we have been sharing our experience in courses, workshops and forums with the public sector, communications conglomerates and social organisations. The continuous increase in our workload, the number of projects and their magnitude explain why we have had a lower level of awareness activity.</p>

            <h4>Training</h4>
            <p>One of our purposes for 2015 was to <strong>have a taste of distance learning</strong>. So we did with an online course for 50 members of the <i>Castilla y León</i> regional government public service staff, that lasted 18 hours and dealt with “Tools for public data processing”.</p>

            <p>Another highlight was a <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/11/taller-para-ong-sobre-acceso-a-la-informacion-y-transparencia-al-servicio-del-cambio-social-17-de-noviembre/" title="Civio - A workshop for NGOs on access to information and transparency for social change: November, 17th" target="_blank">workshop <strong>to help other social organisations</strong></a> exert their right to access administrative information. Conducted by the team of the Civio foundation, and counting on the collaboration of the <a href="http://consejodetransparencia.es/ct_Home" title="Council for Transparency" target="_blank">Council for Transparency</a>, it counted on the participation of representatives form organisations such as Greenpeace, the Consumers' Association, Medicus Mundi, Save the Children, PorCausa, NoGracias or Fíltrala, among others.</p>
            <p>One more year, the team of Civio delivered lessons in the main <strong>Spanish postgraduate programmes in journalism</strong>: the Masters' degree in Journalism at El País-Madrid Autonomous University School of Journalism, as well as El Mundo Master's degree in Research, Data and Visualization Journalism at Rey Juan Carlos University. We also participated in the journalism congress of Miguel Hernández University at Elche, in a data journalism course for Vocento-Medialab and in two distance workshops for La Rioja International University.</p>
